# Tricky's Project Graveyard

The description says it all. Where my discontinued projects go to die.
I've loads of discontinued projects, mostly because I've moved on to a new chapter of my personal development as a coder or sometimes due to technical issues.

Now throwing older projects away completely, could be a way to go, but sometimes my dead projects do still contain some stuff I may need, plus it's nice to keep a kind of history about myself.

If you think these discontinued projects are still of use to you, you may still fork them. Please keep in mind that the license I set for them will still be in order unless I explicitly stated otherwise in either this text or in the repository's documentation itself. 

It goes without saying that should you find any repositories here that still have an issue tracker allowing you to report stuff, that doing so is pretty useless, since ALL projects in this origanization have been discontinued. So any issues here will be ignored (and persisting to post issues in this organization may eventually even get you banned from posting in all of my repositories).
